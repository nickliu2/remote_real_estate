# Real Estate and Remote Work: Analyzing the Impact on Major Cities

## Abstract / Overview

With remote work becoming more prevalent in the current work culture in the U.S., there has been a lot of speculation on how that will affect demand in the U.S. real estate market. As a result, in this project, we investigated the impact of the shift towards remote work on demand for residential real estate in major cities in the United States. By analyzing data on remote work rates and real estate metrics, we explored correlations and trends to understand the relationship between remote work and real estate demand. Our results indicated weak to moderate correlations, with some positive correlations found between remote work rates and the median sale price and average sale to list data. Our analysis also revealed that remote work rates spiked significantly after the start of the pandemic, and eventually settled at a higher rate than pre-COVID levels.
